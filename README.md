# Hello and Welcome to my coding adventures! 👨🏻‍💻

👋 Hello there! I'm Santiago Quintana, a passionate 21-year-old computer science student from 🇲🇽 Tecnologico de Monterrey. I'm thrilled to share my journey in the world of code and CompSci with you. 

## About Me 

📚 I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, where I dive deep into algorithms, data structures, and software development. The endless possibilities in the tech realm have always fascinated me. I'm especially fascinated with cybersecurity and game development. 

🤖 I had the incredible opportunity to become a programming and electrical mentor at OVERTURE 7421 a team for FIRST FRC (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) for the last two years. Working with aspiring young minds, fostering their enthusiasm for robotics, and empowering them to think creatively has been a truly rewarding experience. 

## What I Bring to the Table 

💡 Curiosity, enthusiasm and a constant search for bettering myself are the driving forces behind my work. I'm constantly seeking new challenges to expand my skill set and knowledge. With every project, I aim to deliver innovative solutions and elegant code.

🌟 I possess a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java and C++. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with web development using HTML, CSS, DJango.

🔧I thrive in collaborative environments, though I can shine as well in solo work. Working as a team or alone, brainstorming ideas is essential for me and my fellow developers. I value teamwork, open communication, and the opportunity to learn from others.

## Projects I'm Proud Of 🏆

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. 🤖 **overftclib / overftclib-rc** - A modern up to date library for FTC robots based on CommandBase and the FRCWPILib. A all-in-one alternative to the many outdated FTC Libraries.
