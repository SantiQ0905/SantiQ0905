# Hello and Welcome to my coding adventures! 🎉

👋 Hello there! I'm Santiago Quintana, a passionate 21-year-old computer science student from 🇲🇽 Tecnologico de Monterrey. I'm thrilled to share my journey in the world of code and CompSci with you. 🚀

## About Me 🙋‍♂️

📚 I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, where I dive deep into algorithms, data structures, and software development. The endless possibilities in the tech realm have always fascinated me. I'm especially fascinated with cybersecurity and game development. 

🤖 I had the incredible opportunity to become a programming and electrical mentor at OVERTURE 7421 a team for FIRST FRC (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) for the past year and a half. Working with aspiring young minds, fostering their enthusiasm for robotics, and empowering them to think creatively has been a truly rewarding experience. 🤝

## What I Bring to the Table 💼

💡 Curiosity, enthusiasm and a constant search for bettering myself are the driving forces behind my work. I'm constantly seeking new challenges to expand my skill set and knowledge. With every project, I aim to deliver innovative solutions and elegant code.

🌟 I possess a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, and C++. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with web development using HTML, CSS.

🔧I thrive in collaborative environments, though I can shine as well in solo work. Working as a team or alone, brainstorming ideas is essential for me and my fellow developers. I value teamwork, open communication, and the opportunity to learn from others.

## Projects I'm Proud Of 🏆
Work in progress....
